Matters needing attention:

1.Fonts:
	The files named def.lua and youyuan.lua under this mod folder are two kinds of characters' fonts.
	The former is a pixel-style font, and the latter is rounded.
	The def.lua is used to display defaulted, and the youyuan.lue needs to specify the font name when being used.
	You can input "write ABC" and "write ABC youyuan" when you want to use these two kinds of fonts.
2.Language:
	This mod has an another language which is different from original game, traditional Chinese.
	You can change two files in this mod to use this language in the game.
	(1)Rename the folder "ja_tc" in the path of \lang\ to "ja";
	(2)Rename the file "lang_names_tc" in the path of \lang\ to "lang_names".
	And then, open the game and you will find the "ÕýówÖÐÎÄ" language. Then, choose it and reboot the game.
3.Assembly:
	There are three kinds of assemblies of this mod, and the path of them is .\HelpDocs\Assembly\
	(1)ReplaceableRegions is a region-plugin file.
		(a)1.regions-Picsay.lua is a very easy modal region file, and you can complete the game process quickly.
		(b)2.regions-Easy.lua is an easy modal region file, which will set a much easier extra reassemble universe.
	   	(c)3.regions-Normal.lua is used in this mod acquiescently, whose difficulty is moderate.
		(d)4.regions-Hard.lua is a hard modal region file, which will set a challenging extra reassemble universe.
		(e)5.regions-Compatible.lua is a compatible modal region file, which can be used when loading other mods.
	   Using Way: Change its name to regions.lua and replace it with the same-name file (regions.lua) under the folder
	   of ExtraReassembly.
	(2)CustomFonts is a fonts document, which has two kinds of fonts.
	   Just enter the geme, and you will see the words "ExtraReassembly", these words setted by fonts.
	   I separate the fonts and some related documents for one who needs to use.
